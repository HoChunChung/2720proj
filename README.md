hello chat

don't forget to run npm install in 2720proj/ first!
Maybe we can do one page

Uh yea we also need to make a report bruh
See the link in the discord

# File structure

## page

One js file per page/subpage I think would be tidier
just type `export default` before the function declarations
then when you need it in other file call at the start `import PageName from"./pages/PageName.js"`

## components

One jsx file in components/ too
again use `export` and `import "./FileCard.js"`
